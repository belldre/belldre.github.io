## About Me

I am a Network Engineer with thirteen years of military service, currently transitioning into Cybersecurity Analysis. My background provides a strong foundation in critical infrastructures and a mission-focused mindset. I am studying at [The Tech Academy&#39;s Cyber Security Boot Camp](https://www.learncodinganywhere.com), focusing on scripting languages, front & back-end security, and core cybersecurity principles. I aim to deepen my understanding of browser security and enhance my skills in JavaScript, Node.js, and Angular TypeScript to build secure web applications.
